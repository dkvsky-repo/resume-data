Hi! I'm David Kontorovsky, feel free to call me DK. I'm a Front-End Engineer based in Orange County, California. I'm all about user interfaces, components, decoupled applications and design systems. Ocassionally, I also tinker with backend code and it's a lot of fun.

I have 7+ years of experience, and I have worked with a really wide range of technologies, frontend and backend, that go from good 'ol LAMP/LEMP stack (Linux, Apache/nginx, MySQL, PHP), WordPress and Drupal sites; to more modern Javascript/ES6+, TypeScript, React, NextJS, Gatsby, GraphQL, Apollo, headless CMS systems, Node, Express, and so much more.

As much as I love coding, I also love photography, traveling to beach destinations with my family, and gadgets.
