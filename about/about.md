Hi! I'm DK. I'm a front-end engineer based in Orange County, California. I'm all about user interfaces, components, decoupled applications and design systems. Ocassionally, I also tinker with backend code and it's fun.

I have 7+ years of experience and I have worked with a wide range of technologies like JavaScript(ES6+), TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo, CSS/Saas, NodeJS, Express, NextJS, Gatsby, static site generators like 11ty, and more.

A few more things about me: I love photography, traveling to beach destinations, gadgets and I speak Spanish.
