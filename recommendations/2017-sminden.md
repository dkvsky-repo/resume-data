David was a valuable member of the JStokes team. As our Senior Web Developer, we relied on him to execute everything from landing experiences to digital banners to mobile-first websites. No matter how big or small the project, he met the challenge with positive energy and expertise. He's the kind of guy who is constantly learning new tools, and trying to find better ways of doing things. A true team player and genuinely nice person to work with, David would be an asset to any organization or agency.
