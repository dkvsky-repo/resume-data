I have had the pleasure of working with David over the last 4 years. I appreciate his willingness to take on scrum master responsibilities in addition to being a developer on that same team at Workday. He is a natural in the scrum master role due to his people skills. As a developer, he was always open to learning new technologies whether it was for a project at work or for his own professional development. His learnings benefitted his team mates, as he was always willing to share his knowledge. I thoroughly enjoy working with him.
